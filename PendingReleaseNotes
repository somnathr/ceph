* The *_kb perf counters on the monitor have been removed.  These are
  replaced with a new set of *_bytes counters (e.g., cluster_osd_kb is
  replaced by cluster_osd_bytes).

* The rd_kb and wr_kb fields in the JSON dumps for pool stats (accessed via
  the 'ceph df detail -f json-pretty' and related commands) have been replaced
  with corresponding *_bytes fields.  Similarly, the 'total_space', 'total_used',
  and 'total_avail' fields are replaced with 'total_bytes', 'total_used_bytes',
  and 'total_avail_bytes' fields.

* The 'rados df --format=json' output 'read_bytes' and 'write_bytes'
  fields were incorrectly reporting ops; this is now fixed.

* The 'rados df --format=json' output previously included 'read_kb' and
  'write_kb' fields; these have been removed.  Please use 'read_bytes' and
  'write_bytes' instead (and divide by 1024 if appropriate).


v0.85
-----

* The client-side caching for librbd is now enabled by default (rbd
  cache = true).  A safety option (rbd cache writethrough until flush
  = true) is also enabled so that writeback caching is not used until
  the library observes a 'flush' command, indicating that the librbd
  users is passing that operation through from the guest VM.  This
  avoids potential data loss when used with older versions of qemu
  that do not support flush.

    leveldb_write_buffer_size = 32*1024*1024  = 33554432  // 32MB
    leveldb_cache_size        = 512*1024*1204 = 536870912 // 512MB
    leveldb_block_size        = 64*1024       = 65536     // 64KB
    leveldb_compression       = false
    leveldb_log               = ""

  OSDs will still maintain the following osd-specific defaults:

    leveldb_log               = ""
